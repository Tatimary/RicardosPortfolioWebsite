<h3>Why use blockchain? </h3>
<p><b>Blockchain </b>technology offers enhanced security. It does this by using a digital decentralized ledgar.
In most cases this ledgar is <b>transparent</b> and <b>verifiable</b>, <b>trustless</b> and <b>secure</b></p>

<h3><i>Want a career in blockchain? Here's how you can fast track this process!</i><h3>
<h4>The following is a list of some important libraries and programming languages to learn in order of importance.</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Solidity</li>
        <li>Javascript</li>
        <li>Web3.js and/or Ethers.js ~ <i>These two libraries allow you to build websites that can communicate with smart contracts</i></li>
        <li>React.js</li>
        <li>Node.js or NMP</li>
        <li>Express.js</li>
        <li>React Native/Expo</li>
    </ol>
<h4>Here are also some important frameworks and technologies to get familiar with!</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Truffle ~<i>An Ethereum smart contract framework!</i></li>
        <li>Metamask ~<i>A browser wallet that supports Ethereum tokens and sidechains</i></li>
        <li>Ganache ~<i>A blockchain that runs natively on your computer so that you can test your smart contracts before deploying them on a live network.</i></li>
    </ul>
<h4>This may be a very cool tech stack to get familiar with, however what do blockchain devs do with this tech?</h4>
<p> blockchain developer is kind of a blanket term, for a person with a skill set that can help build or build on block chain technology such as Ethereum.
<br><i>Heres a small list of some the roles and responibilities of a blockchain developer.</i></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Write Smart Contracts</li>
        <li>Build Blockchain Websites and UI's</li>
        <li>Build Mobile Blockchain Applications</li>
        <li>Build Blockchain Backends and Web Servers <i> ~ An example of this would be displaying real time crypto currency prices on a webpage, or data from a blockchain.</i></li>
        <li>Build infrustructure <i>~ Building blockchains from the ground up, fine tuning or updating existing blockchains.</i></li>
    </ul>
    <h4>To get started as a developer there are a few things that you will need to do.</h4>
    <p>Firstly, you will need to get a development environment setup. To start simply, you can just use a browser based IDE called <b>Remix.</b> However, ultimately if you want to become a professional
    developer you will need to get a local environment setup. To do this, you will need to get <b>node.js</b> installed through the command line terminal as well as install <b>Truffle.</b></p>
<h4>In case you didn't know, getting a job in blockchain is not the only way you can make money!</h4>
<p>Here are just a few ways you can money in crypto.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Trading bots that take advantage of arbitrage</li>
        <li>Flash loans</li>
        <li>Yield farming</li>
        <li>Staking</li>
    </ul>
